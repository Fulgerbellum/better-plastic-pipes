# better-plastic-pipes
Better Plastic Pipes is intended for use as a dedicated reskin for Call a Plumber. They can also be used standalone as an alternative pipe that is massively immune to acid damage at the cost of brittle fragility to physical damage.  Includes an optional rebalance I spent enough time on to include if it sounds appealing to you.


The rebalance I've included was made to my personal liking and included as a preset if it sounds like your thing. 

Plastic pipes and pressure vessels now become fluoropolymer pipes and barrels and are gated to fluorine on Aquillo. In exchange for this, steel pipes are sufficient for sulfuric acid. Extremely concentrated SA, like that used in etching advanced electronics, is properly transported by carbon steel whereas more dillute SA will not form the required iron sulfide barrier to prevent corrosion. Since advanced processors are the highest common denomenator amongst vanilla uses, that's why we'll abstractify and say that's what it is. Magic batteries, space uranium. It's fine.
